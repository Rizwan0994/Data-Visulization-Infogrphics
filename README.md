<h3>About Task:</h3>
This visualization helps users understand the relationship between climate change, CO2 emissions, and energy consumption. It displays key statistics such as mean CO2 emissions and median GDP, and shows the correlation between these two variables.

The first plot, a histogram of CO2 emissions, shows that the data is skewed right, with a long tail of high emission values. The vertical line representing the mean value helps users understand the central tendency of the data.

The second plot, a scatter plot of GDP versus CO2 emissions, shows a positive linear relationship between the two variables. The correlation annotation indicates how strong this relationship is, which helps users understand how much of an impact economic growth has on CO2 emissions.

The third plot, a bar chart of the top 10 CO2 emitters by country, provides users with a visual representation of which countries are contributing the most to global emissions.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth plots, line plots of CO2 emissions from coal, oil, and gas consumption over time, respectively, show how emissions from each energy source have changed over time. This helps users understand how energy consumption patterns have contributed to climate change.

Overall, this visualization tells the story of how climate change is linked to CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and provides users with a comprehensive understanding of the issue.
